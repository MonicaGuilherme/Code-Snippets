# 🧩 Code Snippets

This repository is a personal collection of small code experiments, learning notes, and isolated solutions to specific coding problems. It's not meant to be a polished project, but rather a sandbox for:

- Testing ideas 💡  
- Documenting tricky concepts or bugs 🐞  
- Practicing syntax and patterns ⚙️  

## About

Each folder or file is self-contained and usually reflects:

- Something I'm currently learning  
- A particular problem I'm trying to solve  
- A technique or concept I want to revisit later  

This repo will grow over time and include code in various languages as I expand my knowledge.  
Feel free to explore, borrow, or comment, it’s an open and evolving part of my learning journey.

## 🛠️ Tech / Tools

- Java  
- JavaScript  
- HTML / CSS  
- Other languages I’ll be learning  
- Miscellaneous utilities or frameworks as needed

> ⚠️ This repo is not meant for production — it’s an evolving notebook of code.
